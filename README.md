# HSI-UNET

This project attempts to use Pytorch to implement the PSE-UNET model, a variant of U-NET, for use in hyperspectral imagery segmentation. 

The idea is to initially apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, then include a squeeze and excitation block as an attention mechanism to prioritize bands that contain the important features. 
More information on the model can be found here: [Semantic Segmentation of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images Based on PSE-UNet Model](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/24/9678)

**Please note that this project is still a work in progress and will be undergoing refinement**
